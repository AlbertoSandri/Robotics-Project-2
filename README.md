# Robotics second project 2022
Description of the project in the pdf file **Project2** with the related bags in their folder. 
The **documentation** file explains all the files in the repository, the structure of our solution and how to run it.

## Short description of the project


Given 3 ROS bags with recorded data of an omnidirectional robot with four meccanum wheels and some geometric parameters of the robot, the goals to achieve using ROS are:
1. Use 1 bag to write the launch files for the map creation;
2. Use 2 bags to write the launch files to perform amcl-based localization;
3. Write a service to save an image with the map and the trajectory of the robot.
